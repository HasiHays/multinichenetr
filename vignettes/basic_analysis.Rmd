In this vignette, you can learn how to perform a basic spatially aware cell-cell communication analysis. 

The pipeline of a basic analysis consist mainly of the following steps:

* 1. Integration of scRNAseq with spatial transcriptomics data to spatially annotate cells
* 2. Perform cell-cell communication analysis for cells residing in same spatial regions

This vignette guides you in detail through all these steps. As example expression data of interacting cells, we will use data from XXX.

# Step 0: Load required packages and processed scRNAseq and Visium expression data
