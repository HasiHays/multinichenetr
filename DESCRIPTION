Description: This package allows you the investigate intercellular communication from a computational perspective. 
    It is an extension of the NicheNet framework (https://github.com/saeyslab/nichenetr) to better suit scRNAseq datasets with complex designs.
    These datasets can contain multiple samples (e.g. patients) over different groups of interest (e.g. disease subtypes). 
    With MultiNicheNet, you can now better analyze the differences in cell-cell signaling between the different groups of interest.
    MultiNicheNet will give a you a list of the ligand-receptor interactions that are most strongly differentially expressed between patients of the different groups, and also most active in the different groups as given by the NicheNet ligand activity.
