**multinichenetr: the R package containing multiple functionalities to computationally study cell-cell communication from single-cell transcriptomics data with complex multi-sample, multi-group design.** The goal of this toolbox is to study differences in intercellular communication between groups of samples of interest (eg patients of different disease subtypes). 


## Main functionalities of multinichenetr

Specific functionalities of this package include: 

* Finding differential expressed and active ligand-receptor interactions from different sender-receiver pairs between different sample groups

## Installation of multinichenetr

Installation typically takes a few minutes, depending on the number of dependencies that has already been installed on your pc.

You can install multinichenetr (and required dependencies) from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("saeyslab/nichenetr")
devtools::install_github("browaeysrobin/multinichenetr")
```

multinichenetr was tested on both Windows and Linux (most recently tested R version: R 4.0.3)

## Learning to use multinichenetr

In the following vignettes, you can find how to do a multi-sample, multi-group NicheNet analysis:
