\usage{
make_ligand_activity_target_plot(group_oi, receiver_oi, prioritized_tbl_oi, ligand_activities_targets_DEgenes, contrast_tbl, grouping_tbl, receiver_info, ligand_target_matrix, plot_legend = TRUE, heights = NULL, widths = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{group_oi}{Character vector: name of the group of interest}

\item{receiver_oi}{Name of the receiver cell type of interest for which expression of genes should be visualized}

\item{prioritized_tbl_oi}{Subset of `prioritization_tables$group_prioritization_tbl`: the ligand-receptor interactions shown in this subset will be visualized: recommended to consider the top n LR interactions of a group of interest, based on the prioritization_score (eg n = 50; see vignettes for examples).}

\item{ligand_activities_targets_DEgenes}{Sublist in the output of `multi_nichenet_analysis`}

\item{contrast_tbl}{Table to link the contrast definitions to the group ids.}

\item{grouping_tbl}{Data frame linking the sample_id, group_id and covariate_oi}

\item{receiver_info}{`receiver_info` or `celltype_info` slots from the output of `multi_nichenet_analysis`. Also: part of the output of `get_abundance_expression_info_separate`}

\item{ligand_target_matrix}{Prior knowledge model of ligand-target regulatory potential (matrix with ligands in columns and targets in rows). See https://github.com/saeyslab/nichenetr.}

\item{plot_legend}{if TRUE (default): show legend on the same figure, if FALSE (recommended): show legend in separate figure}

\item{heights}{Vector of 2 elements: height of the ligand-activity-target panel, height of the target expression panel. Default NULL: automatically defined based on nr of ligands and samples. If manual change: example format: c(1,1)}

\item{widths}{Vector of 3 elements: Width of the scaled ligand activity panel, width of the ligand activity panel, width of the ligand-target heatmap panel. Default NULL: automatically defined based on nr of target genes and group-receiver combinations. If manual change: example format: c(1,1,10)}
